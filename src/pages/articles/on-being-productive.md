Over the last year or so I've been on a search to become a more productive version of myself. I was transitioning to a fully-remote job and I wanted to make sure I wouldn't waste my time sufing the web or watching _just one more_ episode of X, because I know I could üòá.

There's also another aspect of being and feeling productive beyond your professional goals. I would have much better mental and emotional health if I felt that my day was productive. I would be a more loving husband, a more patient father, just a happier person. On the other hand, I would be more anxious if I hand't deliver what I set out to do. _I'm not being valuable to my team!_, _Am I gonna get fired?_, _Now I have to do two-days worth of work in one day?_ üò±

All of that led me to try a bunch of different techniques, rituals, systems that could help me organize my thoughts and focus on what I needed to do to be productive. I've listed down below what I've found most helpful and I hope it helps you as well üòä‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Plan Ahead

This is easily the single most impactuf thing you can do to boost your productivity.
